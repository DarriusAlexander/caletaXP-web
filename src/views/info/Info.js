              CaletaXP aims to become a core piece of infrastructure in our bid to
              gamify life, by dishing out XP in native chats before people are
              even aware of web3.

              Start by adding the Telegram bot (caletaXP bot) to your chat. The
              only two commands we support at this stage are: /help and /1up
              @username to dish out points.
